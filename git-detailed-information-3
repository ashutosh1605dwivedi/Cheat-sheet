1.  Git status - This command is used to display the current status of git repository. It provides information about the current working directory, staging area and the relationship between local and remote repositories. 
(i) Branch information - This command allows the name of the current branch you are on. It indicates which branch you are wroking on, allowing you to keep track of your progress within the repository.
(ii) Working directory status - This displays the status of your files in the working directory. It shows modifications, additions or deletion made to file since commkit.
(iii) Staging area status - The command also provides information about the staging area. The staging area is where you prepare and stage changes before commiting them.
 Git Revert - This command can be used as undo type command, however this is not traditional undo operation.  Instead of removing the commit from the project history, it figures out how to invert the changes introduced by the commit and appends a new commit with the resulting inverse content. This prevents Git from losing history, which is important for the integrity of your revision history and for reliable collaboration.
 2. Git Reset - This command is complex and versatile tool for undoing changes. It has three primary forms of invocation. These forms correspond to command line arguments --soft, --mixed, --hard. The three arguments each correspond to Git's three internal state management mechanism's, The Commit Tree (HEAD), The Staging Index, and The Working Directory.
 3. Git rm - This command is used to remove individual files or a collection of files. Additionally, git rm can be used to remove files from both the staging index and the working directory. There is no option to remove a file from only the working directory.
